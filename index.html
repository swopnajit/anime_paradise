      <h2>Naruto</h2>
      <p>Naruto Uzumaki (うずまきナルト, Uzumaki Naruto) is a shinobi of Konohagakure's Uzumaki clan. He became the jinchūriki of the Nine-Tails on the day of his birth — a fate that caused him to be shunned by most of Konoha throughout his childhood. After joining Team Kakashi, Naruto worked hard to gain the village's acknowledgement all the while chasing his dream to become Hokage.</p>

      <h2>Dragon Ball Z</h2>
      <p>Dragon Ball is a franchise that extends far beyond Super Saiyans, power levels, and villains whose ashes literally need to be obliterated from existence for them to actually die. Any series that's run as long as Dragon Ball has gone through several phases. Although the original manga was simply titled Dragon Ball, Toei Animation chose to split their adaptations up.</p>

    <div class="anime-info">
      <h2>Solo Leveling</h2>
      <p>In traditional iseaki fashion, Solo Leveling explores a character who starts at the very bottom and climbs their way to the top. In order to take care of his mother, Sung Jinwoo becomes a Hunter -- a group of people whose jobs are to kill monsters and demons in dungeon raids. The only problem is that Jinwoo is an E-Rank Hunter -- the lowest of the low, with E-Rank Hunters are usually the first ones to die either because the monsters target the weak, or simply because the other Hunters leave them to die.</p>
